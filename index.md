# Overview

This graduate seminar provides students an introduction to the study of social networks. This course approaches networks as an orienting perspective, as a set of methods, and as a topic of empirical investigation. Because the study of networks is interdisciplinary, we read materials from many different fields. Statistical knowledge equivalent to what is provided in SOC 500/SOC 504 is assumed.

# Learning objectives

- Students will be able to <emph>describe</emph> foundational ideas used in the study of networks and the interconnections between these ideas.
- Students will be able to <emph>use</emph> these ideas to gain insight into real-world phenomena.
- Students will be able to <emph>evaluate</emph> research that applies these ideas to real-world phenomena.
- Students will be able to <emph>create</emph> research about real-world phenomena.
