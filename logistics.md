## Laptop policy

In order to promote student learning and class discussion, this class is laptop-free by default. However, if you would like to use a laptop please send me an email explaining why. No reasonable request will be refused. 

If you do use a laptop, please do so in a way that does not distract others in the class.


## Generative AI policy

You can use generative AI while you are doing the reading and preparing for class. In fact, we are curious about how you are using it, and we ask about it each week in the quiz.

You cannot use generative AI on the quizzes, in the class, or on the oral exam.

You must follow Princeton's general [policy on acknowledgement of generative AI](https://rrr.princeton.edu/students-and-university/24-academic-regulations#comp246).


## Quizzes

Each week you will complete a quiz on Canvas that is due by 1pm on the day of the class. The quiz has two parts:

1. **Multiple choice questions**: These are designed to ensure that you have engaged with the readings. The quiz is open book but you can't use generative AI.

2. **Discussion prompt**: You will submit a short discussion prompt that will guide class discussion. The better prompts students submit, the better discussions we will have.


## Office hours

My office hours are posted on Canvas. Just stop by. Or, if you can't come at those times, email me to set up a time.

Sometimes students don't feel comfortable coming to office hours so let me provide some examples of what we can talk about in office hours:
- Specific things you don't understand (e.g., I don't understand Fig 2 of Travers and Milgram (1969). Can you walk me through it?)
- General things you don't understand (e.g., I didn't understand any of empirical studies of the small world phenomena. Can you help me make sense of them?)
- Things you learned about in class that you'd like to learn more about (e.g., I loved that paper on power law networks. What can I read to learn more about it?)
- Things related to our class that you are encountering in other classes or in your life
- Anything else you'd like to talk about
