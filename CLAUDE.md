# Project Instructions

This is a course website for a graduate seminar on social networks at Princeton University (Fall 2025).

You can find previous course websites by this instructor here: 
http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/teaching.shtml

The website is based on a template system described here: https://github.com/jan-martinek/gh-syllabus. Please write in the markdown format it expects.

This is a basic course website. Keep things simple and straightforward. Avoid over-engineering solutions or adding unnecessary complexity.

The website is under version control and all commits will be public. Please write atomic commits with crisp commit messages.

When adding citations, follow the existing reference style in the readings.md file (e.g., Author/Authors [Last name only] (Year). Title. _Journal_, volume:pages.).
